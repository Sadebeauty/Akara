        Akara is an African cuisine that originated from the Yoruba culture, it
        is made from peeled beans (black-eyed peas), washed and ground with
        pepper, and other preferred seasonings, then beaten to aerate them, and
        deep-fried in small balls. Akara plays a significant role in the Yoruba
        culture, as it is specially prepared when a person who has come of age
        (70 and above) dies. It is usually prepared in large quantities and
        distributed across every household close to the deceased. Akara also
        used to be prepared in large as a sign of victory, when warriors came
        back victorious from war. The women, especially the wives of the
        Warriors were to fry Akara and distribute it to the villagers. Akara (as
        it is known in southwest Nigeria) a recipe and is a popular breakfast
        dish, eaten with millet or corn pudding. In Nigeria, Akara is commonly
        eaten with bread, akamu ogi (or eko), a type of cornmeal made with fine
        corn flour.
